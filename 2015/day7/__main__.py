# Tue May 13 14:27:55 BST 2025:
# I realised that I might take long breaks on advent of code,
# so from now on I'm going to add dates to my comments (using
# `date | pbcopy` on Linux/MacOS). This will make it much easier
# to piece together what I was thinking of at the time.
#
# I don't usually do this because it makes the code a bit harder
# to read and most code comments don't need timestamps to understand
# why it was done that way.
#
# Adding what I think are the right dates to the current code comments...

# Tue May 13 14:32:40 BST 2025: only two comments? okay then

# Tue May 13 14:38:03 BST 2025: note to later self; should i be
# 1. getting the date, then writing the comment?
# or
# 2. writing the comment, then getting the date?
# going to try option 2 for the rest of this code...


# 05/12/2024: I only have one instruction that leads to wire a
# (`lx -> a`) near the top and lx should be empty, so 0??
# (No, order dosen't matter here.)


# 05/12/2024:
# s1: parse wire signal flow
#       - grab integer -> wire instructions first
#       - connect each wire class with an input and output(s)
# s2: send the signal down to the last wire
# s3: output each wire and their input signal


# Tue May 13 15:02:05 BST 2025:
# Figured it out. Since 'each wire can only get a signal from one source',
# the variable after the arrow can be placed into a list of items:
#
# {
#     "x": 123,
#     "y": 456,
#     "d": math.nan,
#     "e": math.nan,
#     "f": math.nan,
#     "g": math.nan,
#     "h": math.nan,
#     "i": math.nan
# }
#
# To solve the vars with nan values, I need to take the vars with numbers
# and insert them into the instructions. It should look a bit like:
# (<Instruction.AND: 'AND'>, 'x', 'y', 'd')
# to
# (<Instruction.AND: 'AND'>, 123, 456, 'd')
# which in the list will be turned into `"d": 72`


# regex expressions
# Tue May 13 16:34:59 BST 2025: bro didn't add + on the last [a-z]
# Tue May 13 16:36:38 BST 2025: forgot about `lx -> a`, now dealing with variable replacements
# Tue May 13 16:39:16 BST 2025: technically it can be a subset of START... let's see if that will work
# Tue May 13 16:43:13 BST 2025: ...the examples they give are very lackluster
#                               now i gotta force in support for wires that have numbers AND letters...
